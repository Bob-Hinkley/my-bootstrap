# My Bootstrap: Cats Edition

In this exercise, you will practice using Bootstrap to update this web page.

## Three Breakpoints

Use Bootstrap's grid styles to make this website to display differently depending on its size. For centering of page content, you will also need to add some additional Bootstrap styles.

The various views you'll need to create are below.

### Smallest

### Medium

### Largest

## Hard Mode

Add a navigation bar that jumps to each cat. Yes, use Bootstrap's nav classes to make it responsive.

## Hard Mode 2
Also, you probably only need the above nav bar if the user is in the smallest view, so only display it at that time.

## Pro Mode

Add your own styles via a `my-styles.css` file to make this website more visually appealing...or interesting/weird.
